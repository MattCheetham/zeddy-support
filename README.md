# Zeddy Bug & Feature Request Tracker 🐛

This is a bug and feature request tracker for known issues and ongoing requests with [Zeddy](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/zeddy/id1451295003), so if you have a bug to report or a feature you would like to request, you can check the "Issues" tab to see if it's been reported before. Some bugs are out of my control to fix but some I can definitely help with, so please do report them.

### How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is super fast (and free) to do.

Then, go to the “Issues” tab at the top, then select “New Issue” and simply fill in the form. *Please* make sure you include as much of the requested information as possible, it helps me out a ton! Please be polite in the discussions as well.

### How do I request a feature?

Follow the same steps as reporting a bug but when you press "New Issue" be sure to select the feature request option. Fill out the form and hit submit. Please do check that the feature hasn't already been requested before, and if it has, you can add a smiley vote to indicate that it's something you would like too.

### How do I find out if my bug or feature request has already been reported?

Go to the “Issues” tab at the top, and there's a search bar at the top so you can search to see if it's already been submitted. If not, report away! If it has been reported though feel free to add more information to the discussion, or you can tap the + button with the smiley to vote on it to indicate it affects you too.

### What can I do to help if the bug I'm having an issue with has already been reported?

A massive part of solving a bug is just about reproducing it, which just means being able to consistently make it happen. If I can't make it happen, it's super hard to solve! So if you can make it happen and try to figure out the steps that always make it happen, please post those as a comment on the discussion, it'll help so much!

### Why do I need to sign up for an account here?

GitHub's an awesome site that's really well-suited for bug tracking. It'll keep things more organised than having separate email threads with everyone who is experiencing the same bug. It also allows me to keep everyone updated in one place and you can choose to opt out of the discussion at any time easily.

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Of course! But please try to stay on topic to the specific bug report, so contribute if you feel you can add extra information. If you just want to say "me too", use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction rather than creating another comment. Please keep it friendly in the discussions.

### Can I email you instead?

I'd prefer we started the conversation here but if that's not possible or you need to send me sensitive data then please reach out to me at m4ttcheetham+zeddy@gmail.com
